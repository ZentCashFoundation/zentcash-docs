Mining is essentially the process of using your computer to help verify and secure a cryptocurrency network, in our case, it is the Zent Cash Network. By doing this, you will be rewarded with some Zent Cash.

If you want to learn about cryptocurrencies, mining is a great place to start!

**Please note:** Unfortunately because of some bad people using mining software in malware, most antivirus software will detect the programs below as unsafe.

It is **likely** you will need to add exceptions and exclusions to your antivirus software in order to make things work properly.

### Android

Termux is a mobile CLI app; if you want to use it, you will have to download and compile XMRig on your phone (covered in the guide).
It is NOT a GUI app, and you will need to manually type/paste in commands.
