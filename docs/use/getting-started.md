# Making a Zent Cash Wallet

There are multiple different types of wallets you can choose to use for Zent Cash, paper wallets, CLI wallets, GUI wallets and Web Wallets.

We recommend making a paper wallet so that you can start receiving funds, and later import them into a GUI or CLI wallet.

## Paper Wallet

The main purpose of a paper wallet is to quickly create a wallet to start receiving funds.

**You will not be able to spend or send your funds to other people until you set up a CLI, GUI or Web Wallet.**

To view a guide on how to make a paper wallet, you can go [here](/docs/use/wallets-guides/making-a-paper-wallet).

## Zentwallet (CLI Wallet)

The CLI Wallet, called zentwallet, is a multi-platform program (Win/Linux/Mac) that requires you to enter commands for it to work and you cannot use your mouse. However, it is currently the most stable and gets the newest updates first.

If you would like to use zentwallet, you can check out [this guide](/docs/use/wallets-guides/advanced-wallets/using-zentwallet).

## Zent Cash Wallet (GUI Wallet)

Zent Cash Wallet is a wallet inspired by Electrum's QT Client. It's fast, compatible with the ZentPay™ Blockchain Cache, and utilizing the latest in wallet backend technologies from the core TurtleCoin™ team. It's also open sourced and available on every major OS. You can download it [here](https://github.com/ZentCashFoundation/zentcash-wallet/releases), or view the source code [here](https://github.com/ZentCashFoundation/zentcash-wallet/)
