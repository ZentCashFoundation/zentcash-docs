## How and Why was Zent Cash Created?

Zent Cash was born on February 21, 2019, led by Víctor and Carlos, two visionaries who shared a common passion: changing the way projects are created and valued in the world of cryptocurrencies. From the very beginning, their goal was clear: to develop something real, fun, and accessible to everyone, without relying on excessive advertising or inflated expectations.

At that time, many projects without a tangible product were receiving large amounts of money due to hype and overblown expectations. However, Víctor and Carlos believed that true value is not built on empty words but through actions and products that people can genuinely use and enjoy. Thus, Zent Cash was born with a radically different approach and a simple mission: to create something useful and let its value grow organically.

The team has always believed in authenticity. **With no ICO**, no external funding, and no tricks, Zent Cash is based on the genuine effort of building something valuable from scratch. For them, the key is not to promise wealth or revolution but to create an accessible, entertaining, and reliable experience that speaks for itself.

The journey has not been easy, but Zent Cash has grown with the same philosophy with which it was founded: if something is truly good, people will discover it and adopt it over time. It is a project that values trust, community, and simplicity, demonstrating that passion and honesty can be more powerful than any amount of funding.

Zent Cash is more than a currency. It is a statement: great things can be born without grandiose promises or gimmicks. If we create something authentic, its value will flourish on its own.
